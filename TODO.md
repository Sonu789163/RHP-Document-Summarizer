## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes Made

1. **User Model** (`smart-rhtp-backend/models/User.ts`)

   - Added `role` field: "admin" | "user" (default: "user")
   - Added `status` field: "active" | "suspended" (default: "active")
   - Added indexes for performance

2. **Auth Middleware** (`smart-rhtp-backend/middleware/auth.ts`)

   - Added `authorize(roles)` middleware for role-based access control
   - Block suspended users from accessing any endpoints
   - Enhanced JWT token validation

3. **User Controller** (`smart-rhtp-backend/controllers/userController.ts`)

   - Admin CRUD operations: getAllUsers, getUserById, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser
   - User profile management: getMyProfile, updateMyProfile, changeMyPassword
   - User statistics and activation/deactivation

4. **User Routes** (`smart-rhtp-backend/routes/user.routes.ts`)

   - Admin-only routes: `/api/users/*` (requires admin role)
   - User profile routes: `/api/users/me/*` (accessible to all authenticated users)
   - Proper authorization middleware applied

5. **Document Routes** (`smart-rhtp-backend/routes/document.routes.ts`)

   - Restricted DRHP and RHP uploads to admin users only
   - Regular users can view and download documents but cannot upload

6. **Auth Controller** (`smart-rhtp-backend/controllers/authController.ts`)

   - Enhanced JWT tokens to include user role information
   - Role-based token generation for better security

7. **Server Integration** (`smart-rhtp-backend/index.ts`)

   - Wired user routes to main server
   - Added `/api/users` endpoint

8. **Admin Seeding** (`smart-rhtp-backend/scripts/seedAdmin.js`)

   - Script to create initial admin user
   - Update existing users with default roles and status

### Frontend Changes Made

1. **User Service** (`smart-rhp-pilot/src/lib/api/userService.ts`)

   - Complete API service for admin user management
   - User profile management functions
   - TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
   - Error handling and response typing

2. **Admin Users Page** (`smart-rhp-pilot/src/pages/AdminUsersPage.tsx`)

   - Comprehensive user management interface
   - User statistics dashboard with visual cards
   - Advanced search and filtering (by role, status, name/email)
   - Pagination support
   - Create, edit, activate/deactivate users
   - Role management (promote/demote users to admin)
   - Responsive design with mobile support

3. **Profile Settings Page** (`smart-rhp-pilot/src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`)

   - User profile information display
   - Profile update functionality (name)
   - Secure password change with validation
   - Account summary and security tips
   - Responsive layout with sidebar

4. **Enhanced Auth Context** (`smart-rhp-pilot/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

   - Added role support to user interface
   - Role-based access control in frontend

### API Endpoints Created

#### Admin Only (requires admin role)

- `GET /api/users` - List all users with pagination, search, filters
- `GET /api/users/stats` - User statistics
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get specific user
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (name, role, status)
- `DELETE /api/users/:id` - Deactivate user (soft delete)
- `PATCH /api/users/:id/activate` - Reactivate user

#### User Profile (accessible to all authenticated users)

- `GET /api/users/me/profile` - Get own profile
- `PUT /api/users/me/profile` - Update own profile (name)
- `PUT /api/users/me/password` - Change own password

### Security Features

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Suspended user blocking
- Admin-only document uploads (DRHP and RHP)
- Secure password hashing and validation
- JWT token enhancement with role information
- Frontend role validation and access control

### Frontend Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete user management with statistics
- **User Creation**: Add new users with role assignment
- **Role Management**: Promote/demote users between admin and user roles
- **User Status**: Activate/suspend user accounts
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced user discovery and management
- **Profile Management**: Self-service profile updates and password changes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data refresh after actions
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- **Loading States**: User feedback during operations

### Next Steps

1. **Run the admin seeding script** to create initial admin user:

   ```bash
   cd smart-rhtp-backend
   node scripts/seedAdmin.js
   ```

2. **Test the complete system**:

   - Backend endpoints with proper authorization
   - Frontend admin interface
   - User profile management
   - Role-based access control

3. **Integration testing**:

   - Admin user creation and management
   - Document upload restrictions
   - User role changes and permissions

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy backend with new user management
   - Deploy frontend with admin interface
   - Test in production environment
